My name is Yuhan Li and I am a Ph.D. student in [Communication and Media at the University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/comm/people/graduate-students/yuhan-li.html). My research focuses on science/political communication, social media, and computational social science. I use quantitative and computational methods to study how digital media infrastructure shapes public understanding of controversial social events and how people's policy opinions are formed and swayed by online media campaigns. You can view my [CV](https://lsa.umich.edu/comm/people/graduate-students/yuhan-li.html) here.

I received my M.A. degree from the [School of Journalism and Communication](https://www.tsjc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at Tsinghua University and a B.A. degree in Journalism and Communication at Wuhan University.
